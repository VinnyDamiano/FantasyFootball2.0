# FantasyFootball2.0

This is my term project for 15-112 at carnegie Mellon University. I created Fantasy Football 2.0, which is my own twist on a fantasy football application. Fantasy football is pretty simple. Basically a player creates a lineup of real NFL players based on their position, and gets a weekly score based on how they perform in their real life game, with their score being determined by stats such as yards, touchdowns and receptions. My twist on fantasy football includes a chemistry factor to the players weekley score, which will be based on the players past and current team history. For example, if you decide to put two players on the Packers in your lineup, this will increase your chemistry factor, however if you start a player from the Giants and a player from the Cowboys (these teams are rivals), your chemistry factor will decrease the chemistry factor.
